applications:
- name: web-app       # A default name for Cloud Foundry to give your app

# In the manifest.yml you create you can try the default buildpack
#
#  buildpacks:
#    - ruby_buildpack  # Use the default Ruby buildpack
#
# or tracking the newesr buildpack available
#
#   buildpacks:
#     - https://github.com/cloudfoundry/ruby-buildpack.git
#
# In this manifest we hardcoded the buildpack to v1.7.23 so the Lab will
# still work in the future. Normally you would want to track newer versions
# as they will give you warnings when parts of your application become old
# or end of life
